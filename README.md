All Macros listed are for use in VTT Foundry, Starfinder system.

Any macros that access a set of characters without selection will be looking in the actors director for a folder titled "Player Characters"

Conditions & FX macro requires Token Magic FX mod: https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tokenmagic/

The import settings for Automated Animations use the free JB2A animations and the Games Audio Bundles. Audio references currently reflect Forge's file structure. To fix the audio references, remove "htt<span>ps://ass<span>ets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/" from the beginning of each effected audio.
